to mentor, guide, motivate, support, and assist primarily low-income, hardworking, high-potential/achieving students, and their families, to go to college. Beginning in 7th (or 8th) grade, students will be assigned a HS, college-age, and/or recent grad to email/talk with them weekly (or more) up until their senior year of college about grades, homework, triumphs, struggles, peers, homelife, extracurriculars...  Students and their families will have access to a database of resources (Khan Academy, libraries, free SAT/ACT help, free online tutors, volunteering opportunities...), suggested pathways, courses, and mentors whom they can connect with based on language, ethnicity, gender, high school, college, industry, major, interests, hometown, or favorite sports team.
