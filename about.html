		This past summer, Lizzie, a San Mateo High School alumna, was an 8th grade Algebra Teaching Assistant through <a href = "http://svefoundation.org">Silicon Valley Education Foundation</a>,
		teaching rising East Palo Alto eighth graders Algebra. Though difficult, it was rewarding because of a few students who truly cared about learning. Here, Lizzie got the idea of a remote, simple "mentorship" program and
		online database of mentors to guide a few eighth graders from the program through high school, and then through college. These students had 
		the drive to focus, study, and learn, while some of their peers did not. Despite peer pressure and many distractions, these students maintained focus on their classwork,
		and their dedication to their education will get them far. <span id = "title"><i>Edify101</i></span>is here to assist them on that path by providing feedback and a caring ear--they have the mindset, but to answer questions about college or high school, here we are.
	</br>
</br>
		A <i>New York Times&nbsp;</i><a href = "http://nyti.ms/15j6G33"> article</a>
		explains how a simple, weekly text to a student can make students <span id="stat"><em>70%</em></span> more likely to go to college. <span id = "title"><i>Edify101</i></span> aims to provide mentors to listen, advise, and provide support, whether it be email or phone call, to both the student
		and the family. A little bit goes a long way, and in order to thrive in school, it takes an <span id = "stat"><em>army</em></span>. 
	</br>
</br>
		If a student has a question, or needs someone to talk to, <span id = "title"><i>Edify101</i></span> will give them that option, that chance, that opportunity to be listened to. Maybe they have no one their age to talk to about college, about academics, or to answer their many questions. We can provide the feedback to point them in the right direction.
