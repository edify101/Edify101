This past summer, Lizzie, a CS student at Bryn Mawr College, was a Teaching Assistant through <a href = "http://svefoundation.org">Silicon Valley Education Foundation</a>,
teaching rising East Palo Alto eighth graders Algebra. Though difficult, it was rewarding at times. Lizzie got the idea of a mentorship program and
online database of mentors to guide the few eighth graders from the program through high school, and then through college. These students had 
the drive to focus, study, and learn, while some of their peers did not. Despite peer pressure and many distractions, these students made going to work enjoyable,
and their dedication to their education will get them far. <i>Edify101</i> is here to help.

A <a href = "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/upshot/helping-the-poor-in-higher-education-the-power-of-a-simple-nudge.html?emc=edit_tnt_20150117&nlid=50763249&tntemail0=y&_r=0&abt=0002&abg=0">New York Times article</a>
explains how a simple, weekly text to a student can make them 70% more likely to go to college. <i>Edify101</i> aims to have weekly check-ins, whether it be email or phone call, to both the student
and the family. In order to thrive in school, it takes an army. 
</p>
<p>
Besides weekly (or more) check-ins, <i>Edify101</i> provides an online database of mentors (high school, college, or career professional volunteers) to suggest
courses, extracurriculars, provide support, and more. We hope to also provide SAT and ACT tutoring, as well as college advising.

We need mentors, and you can get community service hours! We need sponsors, and you can get your business's name out there! Contact us on the form on the homepage, at the moment.
