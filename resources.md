<h3>Academic resources</h3>
<p>
The local library is an amazing resource. They provide computers and printers (small fee), as well as some free tutoring services.
My brother took a free practice SAT test at the Burlingame library! In terms of online help, you can't go wrong with Khan Academy--I
still use it!
